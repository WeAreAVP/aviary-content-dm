The **aviary-content-dm** repository provides a **CONTENTdm customization recipe** for embedding the [Aviary platform](https://aviaryplatform.com) directly into a CONTENTdm repository. It consists of two key components: 

1. **`video-stream-embed-1.3.js`**, a JavaScript file adapted from a previous YouTube/Vimeo/Kaltura embed script, which detects CONTENTdm web records containing Aviary resource URLs and dynamically replaces the link with an iframe or div featuring the Aviary resource detail player; and
2. **`aviary-custom.css`**, which adjusts the CONTENTdm item page layout to span the full screen horizontally, ensuring an optimal display for embedded Aviary content.
